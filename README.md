# Guilt-free-gourmet

<!-- # Bear in mind => 
1. We could work with API on either external and local way => Making use of Edamam API
Edamam API can help the user to look for Meal Recommendations Engine
Local API can just provide the user regular meal information.

2. Use the Recipe Search configuration from Edamam in which the user can look through over 2.3 million recipes by diets, calories and nutrient ranges
And then just allow the user to select their favorites recipes => Add items to a shopping cart simulator

Local API => Common Q&A Section to allow the user have more information about how to work with all those healthy plans 

When save them on favorites => An option to save them on a specific day -->
