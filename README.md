## TO DO => Routes are working properly 
1. externalRoutes and favorites folders => Check on the API and requested values.
2. SignUp Form and LoginForm need to be tested => Event Listener for button or form?
3. Having that done => Comments and recipes created by the user test with Insomnia.
4. Check on the CSS for transparency styles.
5. PLUS => If everything is working, check on categories.
